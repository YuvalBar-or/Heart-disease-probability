This project is a Heart Disease Prediction App built with Streamlit and powered by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The app allows users to enter clinical information and calculates the likelihood of heart disease as a percentage, along with a categorized risk level (Low, Medium, or High Risk).


ðŸš€ Features
CNN Model trained on clinical data with 60 epochs for accurate predictions.
Interactive User Interface for easy input of clinical parameters.
Real-time Results displayed as a probability percentage with a color-coded gauge chart.
Fullscreen GIF Animation during prediction for a modern, engaging experience.
Risk Categories:
Low Risk: <30%
Medium Risk: 30â€“70%
High Risk: >70%



ðŸ©º Clinical Parameters
The app uses the following clinical parameters to predict heart disease risk:

Age: Age of the patient in years.
Sex: Biological sex (Male or Female).
Chest Pain Type (0â€“3): Types of chest pain (typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, asymptomatic).
Resting Blood Pressure: Measured in mmHg.
Serum Cholesterol: Measured in mg/dL.
Fasting Blood Sugar: >120 mg/dL (Yes or No).
Resting Electrocardiographic Results (0â€“2): Normal, ST-T wave abnormality, or left ventricular hypertrophy.
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved.
Exercise-Induced Angina: Yes or No.
ST Depression Induced by Exercise: Measured in mm.
Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment (0â€“2).
Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (0â€“3).
Thalassemia (0â€“3): Normal, fixed defect, reversible defect, or unknown.
